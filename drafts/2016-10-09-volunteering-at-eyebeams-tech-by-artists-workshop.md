Volunteered at Eyebeam yesterday for their Tech by Artists workshop. I was glad to be deputized as videographer/photographer for most of the workshop. Here are some of the photos I took of the day:



We started off the day with some great coffee and Mexican pastries from local favorite Ines Bakery. Guava y queso empanadas - yum.

Then Mushon Zer Aviv, Surya Mattu, and Ingrid Burrington gave a fun workshop on thinking about networks.


I was taking pictures, so I wasn’t really able to participate, but people seemed to be having a pretty good time. There was a contingent of undergrads from Hunter College, the five current Eyebeam Research Artists-in-Residence were in attendance, as well as at least one of Eyebeam’s Impact Residents. There we even two middle-school teachers who drove from Connecticut to attend the workshop.

I appreciated Mushon, Surya, and Ingrid, not for their workshop. It seems much more effective to elicit conceptual thinking with the use of materials, collaboration, and dialogue, at least in a group setting.


Participants worked on their concepts and presented:



Then it was lunchtime. After lunch, Allison Burtch, whose teaching credits include teaching a course called Critical Theory of Technology at SFPC, lead a discussion titled: “Politics and Art: Doing Both Is Doing Neither”.



After Allison’s talk, Kevin McCoy and Mushon led a pitch session, in which workshop participants were able to pitch project ideas for critique. No pictures there as I’d begun to primarily shoot video at that point in the workshop.

The workshop was over around 5:30pm. Everyone was thoroughly pooped from the workshop, but some went and got some of the much-lauded Sunset Park tacos, and some opened a beer, and at 6pm the party started.

I enjoyed playing bartender for half an hour, practicing my most jovial patter and making change when I could(beer was free, but donations were accepted). I did short interviews with all 5 female research residents(in order: Nora, Morehshin, Mimi, Macon, and Karolina). I really enjoyed to talking to all of them and really appreciated their participation after a long day at the workshop. Each is doing legitimately interesting work and I hope to work with Eyebeam and them again in documenting their work and time at Eyebeam.

I also got to meet Taeyoon in person, as well as, Yeseul Song, a former SFPC student I’d been corresponding with, who was nice enough to answer some questions I had about what it was like to go through the program.

The whole day was fantastic. I definitely hope to volunteer for Eyebeam again, and possibly even intern if it works out with my SFPC schedule.

More and more, I’m leaning towards staying in New York. We shall see. Just gotta find some paying work so I can afford to stay!
