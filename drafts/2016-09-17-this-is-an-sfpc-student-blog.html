<p>I am attending the <a href="http://www.sfpc.io">School for Poetic Computation</a> in NYC for 10 weeks this Fall.<br/><br/>I am very excited.</p><figure data-orig-width="323" data-orig-height="156" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://67.media.tumblr.com/fbcc3ef5ee6502f9afd22bcb1b3f8192/tumblr_inline_odmrlxRO9g1qa0x9g_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="323" data-orig-height="156"/></figure><p>I’m also very nervous because I would like to be a better programmer. I’m still a noivice and I have trouble executing the few ideas that I do have. I’m pretty sure that I will learn a lot and have lots of fun at SFPC but I’d like to come away with something to show to for my time there. Hopefully, a project(for the ages!).<br/><br/>Anyway, Taeyoon(Choi, one of SFPC’s founders) emailed the class today and suggested some resources to prepare for the program:</p><!-- more --><p><b>Reading:</b></p><ul><li><b><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tlghstn2axkt9gs/AADV_0_9uOhjBblXjeIL037Sa?dl=0">“Code”</a>, by Charles Petzold</b> - ”One of the best introductions to how computers work, includes great chapters about things like binary numbers.”<br/></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/tnmksorg7f647av/GALLOWAY-Alexander.-Protocol.pdf?dl=0"><b>“Protocol”</b></a><b> by Alex Galloway</b> - ”Introduction to critical theory code and network.”<br/></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Uncreative-Writing-Managing-Language-Digital/dp/0231149913"><b>“Uncreative Writing”</b></a> <b>by Kenneth Goldsmith</b> - ”An exploration of a creative process that’s about sampling, remixing and experimenting with text.”<br/></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Madness-Rack-Honey-Collected-Lectures/dp/1933517573"><b>“Madness, Rack, and Honey”</b></a> <b>by Mary Ruefle </b>- ”A beautiful description of what poetry is.”</li></ul><p><b>Coding:</b></p><p>Obviously, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/videos">Dan Shiffman’s Processing and p5 tuts</a>.

Tonight, I studied some of <a href="https://github.com/aparrish/sfpc-gen-text-2015">Allison Parrish’s command-line tuts for generative poetry</a>. As a lover of words(and writer), I really dig her teaching style and tutorials.<br/><br/>I also randomly found kathack.com, which makes me very happy.</p><p>It’s 11pm on a Friday night and I’m sitting on the couch alone in my parents’ house. The cat is sleeping on my arm. I hear the sound of a plane soaring overhead and it kind of pulls me further into the future - like that sound has some sort of inertial force(read: momentum) or something. <br/><br/>In a little over two weeks, I’ll be back in New York. I’d like to stay for good this time, but we’ll see. I need to get my coding skills way, way up to be able to find a job. I guess I can always do video production.<br/><br/>And finding a place to live is a whole other story, for another post entirely.</p><p>I told my friends I would go meet them at a bar downtown at midnight but I think I’d rather just fumble around with my Arduino Uno, mess with a Processing sketch I’ve been working on, and go to bed.<br/><br/>I might go out anyway. You know how it is when you have friends in town.</p><figure data-orig-width="1280" data-orig-height="960" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://67.media.tumblr.com/0dc9ead6a8fe0c72ddfbc80700432df8/tumblr_inline_odmrgscIDC1qa0x9g_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1280" data-orig-height="960"/></figure>
