Today I woke up to a text from my friend Jonathan, who is a video producer I've worked with many times. He wanted to know if I was free to film some post-election interviews. I said, "Yes, of course", and out the door I went, camera bag in hand.

It was a heck of a day. That's right, a heck.

<h2>Post election hangover</h2>

I took the bus, then a train to Trump tower to meet my friend Cecile, who is a French journaliste par excellence.

We were looking for Trump supporters to interview, to explain to a European audience why Donald Trump won.

It was grey and lightly raining.

We soon met Joey, a 24-yo commercial fisherman from Orlando. Joey is also a Latino and a Trump supporter. We spent the day interviewing him, getting shots of him, and then traveling back to Cecile's apartment in Harlem so that we could do a proper sit down interview with him.

Joey was really patient with us, and we were extremely lucky to find him. I don't support Trump but it was interesting to hear Joey's point of view and I do believe that he is a genuinely decent person.

After that, the whole crew - me Melanie Cecile and Joey ubered through rush hour traffic to park slope to interview Jill Stein. It took about an hour and a half to get from Harlem to Park Slope.

I know I know - you're thinking "oh that's the candidate who ruined the election and she doesn't believe in vaccines". Believe what you want about the election, I won't try to convince you of anything, but I can tell you that the notion that Stein doesn't believe in vaccines is misinformation.

I like her. She speaks clearly and thoughtfully. She speaks for peace, progressivism, people. How could I not have a brain crush?

The interview lasted all of 30 minutes. The fact that we got an interview with her on the day after the election is nothing short of amazing, at the very least because campaigning for president is a tough job and she could've easily turned down a small crew from a French television channel

After that, we took another uber to sfpc. We took a picture together and said goodbye to Joey, who declared today "the strangest day of his life(in a good way)".

Cecile began to work on the edit and Melanie and I bought groceries and wine, then we got burgers at The Bus Stop Cafe. A good good meal. Melanie told me the story of how the documentary project came together and we talked about central Oregon and Portland and how pretty that part of the country is.

We returned to sfpc and I helped Cecile with the edit. Everyone ubered their separate ways home at 2a.

How bad is this going to get? I guess we won't know until January.
