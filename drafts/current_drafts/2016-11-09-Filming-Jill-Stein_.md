We had a housing situation debacle today, which seems to have been resolved. Not going to SFPC today. I have my Eyebeam internship in the afternoon, need time to recuperate from, well - *everything that's been happening*.

When it rains it pours.

<h2>Today, In Pictures</h2>

*Gentrification in Bed Stuy*

<h2>This Is Why You Should Never AirBnB for Longer than Two Weeks</h2>

I am living with three international students in an AirBnB in Bed Stuy, Brooklyn.

**For Breakfast:**

A big, cakey donut from a place down the street called Crocus. The service there is terrible - possibly as a reaction to gentrification in Bed Stuy. I'm a white person inhabiting a historically black neighborhood. The staff aren't rude, but there is a subtext of 'why are you here?'. Like when the cashier tried to send me on my way today without giving me my 50 cents change. Or the first time I went in there, when it took half an hour for them to make my veggie burger, while I saw at least two or three people glide in and out of the place with food.

If it sounds like I'm complaining, I'm only trying to reflect my thoughts and experience. If I wanted to complain, I'd go on yelp.

I don't blame them, but I also won't be going back. I wonder if they would treat me differently if they new that I am renting an AirBnB from black property owners in the area?

I don't expect to be able to decode

There's an anti-gentrification movement happening across NYC that I will explore further in these coming months.

**For Dinner:**

? Maybe tacos.
