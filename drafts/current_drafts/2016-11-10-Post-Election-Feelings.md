Woke up to a text this morning about a video gig. Ended up spending all day working on a documentary about The Green Party in the US. Later in the day, we interviewed Jill Stein, Green Party presidential candidate for this year's race.

**For Lunch:**

A real French omelette courtesy of my good friend, Cecile. Life-changing.

**For Dinner:**

A bacon cheeseburger at The Bus Stop Cafe. I'm really starting to like that place. Good stuff.
