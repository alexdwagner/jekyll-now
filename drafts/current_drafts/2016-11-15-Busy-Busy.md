Rainy today. Trains all futzed up. We have a make-up for Ingrid's class, as she was out last week.

<h2>Walking to the Train in the Rain</h2>

Woke up, took a cold shower, did yoga.

Roommate/classmate Dannie and I left the house around 11:30a. It was pretty rainy but not too, too cold. Was somewhat worried about my laptop getting wet but I had to get some school.

Here's some pictures from our walk to our local station in Bed Stuy.

It took us at least two hours to get to SFPC today due to train stoppages and a rerouting to Penn Station. Meh, what can you do? At least I didn't have anywhere to be. We got to school with a couple hours to spare before Ingrid's class. I caught up on the blog.

<h2>Eyebeam Blog Post</h2>

Also, Eyebeam posted [the blog post I wrote for them about Radical Networks](http://eyebeam.org/stopwork/making-networks-radical/) hooray! It's mostly just an interview I conducted and transcribed, but I also took the featured image for the post.
