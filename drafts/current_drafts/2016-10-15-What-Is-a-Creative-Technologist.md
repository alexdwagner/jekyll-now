So, I plan to stay in NYC. 

And the logical continuance of that goal is - *you guessed it* - finding a job.

What do I want to be? *A creative technologist!* What exactly qualifies one to do that? *It's up for debate!*

I found this job posting for "Creative Technologist"(what a lot of us call ourselves, but maybe only a select few really deserve to?) from "experiential design" titan and well-known entity, [Fake Love](http://fakelove.tv/).

I'm not even close to qualified for this job. I've just started learning Open Frameworks and I have no experience managing teams. Despite that, I thought I'd share the job post as a study in what the ad world considers a Creative Technologist to be.

Here's the original post, in iPhone screen caps.

They're asking for a lot, methinks, but what job doesn't nowadays? I hate advertising and working in advertising. I'm not a 9 to 5 guy. Despite all of that, maybe I will apply. It would be really cool to get paid to make interactive, code-based projects for a living, and I wouldn't mind being paid decent money to do so!

Maybe I will see if I can get an introduction, and angle towards securing an entry-level position with them. Notice that this job posting asks for a "senior-level programmer". That's not me, but maybe in a few years?

If I'm going to stay here, I need a job.
