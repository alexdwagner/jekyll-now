Got some much needed sleeping-in sleep, and then - housing search today.

<h2>Today: Housing Search</h2>

Saw a real nice place in Red Hook. Matt, who will be living there and has leased the apartment, is a former Eyebeam resident and teaches Processing at Pratt and Hunter College. The rent's not cheap but nowhere in New York is, unless you get really, really lucky. Yes, I'll be paying $300 more for a room in an industrial part of town than I did for a 1000 sq. foot loft in Dallas, but that was Dallas, this is NYC.

Later, I'll be joining a friend of a friend to look for a place in Bushwick.
