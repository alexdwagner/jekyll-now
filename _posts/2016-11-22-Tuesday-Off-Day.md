Tuesday. A day to catch up on work stuff. My sister and her boyfriend visited the space. Getting ready to go upstate to visit family for Thanksgiving. Should be real nice.

<h2>Today</h2>

No pictures today. No stories today. Just spent most of the day working on client work. Kind of a lost day.

<h2>Freelance</h2>

Freelance work is taking over my life. I feel like I'm not participating in school, really at all, right now. Been like that for the past week, at least.

I think I'm gonna have to put a halt on freelance stuff for these next three weeks.

**Breakfast:**

Poached egg on avo toast.

**For Lunch:**

A chicken burrito from Ines Bakery. It was a week old. I probably should not have eaten it.

**For Dinner:**

Had nachos and mozzarella at Bus Stop Cafe with sister and her boyfriend. Beef stew.
