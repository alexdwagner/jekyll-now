"Hey man, why do you have to take pictures of us?! Why?! What's your problem? Why are you doing this?!"
"I'm sorry, man! ... I'm weird!!"

A fellow worker man with a big smile starts to laugh out loud.

"Hahaha that's the best! 'I'm weird!' Bahahaha!!'"
"Yeah, I'm a photographer and I just like the colors and I - ", the smiling man still laughing, "Have a nice day guys!!"

Satisfied with the interaction, I waved and walked up the stairs to 14th st.

<h2>Ingrid's Class</h2>

We all had to present for our "computational diaries". I did not prepare for class. I felt bad. Ingrid was nice to not make me feel worse about it. I discussed my blog.

**Some thoughts on the blog(so far):**

- **Documentation Fatigue is real:** I'm definitely struggling to keep up the energy with which I started the blog. At this point, I'm 7 or 8 days behind on updating my blog. Luckily, my mother is the only one who reads it. Still, I do not want to disappoint my only reader.
- **The relationship between picture and text:** through this project, I've really been able to explore how words add dimensionality to an image and vice versa.
- **Making a book as a personal document:** I like the idea of creating a book as a document of a period of time spent doing a thing. I look forward to making notes and referring to the book, seeing it on a shelf, thumbing through it, seeing it on my coffee table, packing it in a moving box and moving it from place to place.

<h2>Eyebeam Internship</h2>

Eyebeam internship from 2p-6p. I'm looking forward to being done with school because I will be able ot spend more time at Eyebeam.

It just feels really good to be there. Everyone is nice, intelligent, and cool. I learn a lot when I'm there and I feel like the work I do is appreciated. I look forward to contributing more in the next couple of months.

Once there, had a meeting about video strategy, turned out a couple of rough cuts, put in an order over the phone to Ines Bakery and left at about 6p.

Came home and ate, did laundry, and then rewarded myself with a couple of drinks at the incomparable [Lover's Rock](http://loversrocknyc.com/) reggae bar on Tompkins.

My friend Emily told me about the place a while back, before I came to NYC. Coincidentally, she'll be in town and I'll be meeting her there Friday :D Should be a good time.
