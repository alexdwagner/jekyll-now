<h2>Electronics</h2>

It was really hard for me to pay attention today. I don't get this electronics stuff, never have. Plus, I sleep on a couch at our AirBnB and was grumpy and tired this morning. I feel like I've been doing too much - need to slow down and take care of myself.

**Bright Side:** Glad to finally be comfortable soldering, stripping wire, and using a multimeter to read the resistance of various components.

Also, check out this fun video of Phillip's dog, Norman, vibing out to DIY synth sounds:

<h2>Yoga at the Park on the Pier</h2>

I went to the park on the Hudson to chill out and do some yoga. I had a big lunch earlier, and once I'd rolled out my yoga mat on the grass and kicked off my shoes, I fast a-nap.

When I woke up I was *surrounded by geese.*

I kept waiting for them to converge on me and peck my eyes out, but they never did(lucky me - although I made a promise to myself to go down swinging). They got really, really close, and this one took an interest in me(probably their leader deciding if he was hungry again for the sweet taste of human eyeballs):

*(look at him trying to hide his face)*

Here are some gifs I made of the geese migrating in the park, from the west side to the east. This what they did, the whole time I was there. Peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, aaaaaand reverse.

Things have been tough for the geese in New York since deregulation :(

[I love those geeses to pieces:](https://youtu.be/4gTLxgssOXI?t=2m7s)

After that I did some much, much, MUCH-needed yoga in the park. In Dallas, I did yoga at least once a day. I don't think I've done any yoga since I've been in a NYC. One whole back-murdering month. Lots of walking though, and bike riding. Can't complain too much.

**For Lunch:**

Ramen with an egg and Dannie gave me some chicken.

**For Dinner:**

Heavy Woods, in Bushwick. Heard they fry a killer green tomato.
