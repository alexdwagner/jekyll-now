Stressful day. Mostly spent on client work. Got to catch the tail end of a workshop Zach gave about how he does what he does. Got some great pictures of the demo. Later we had a show work get together.

<h2>Today</h2>

Was unable to attend due to having to take care of some client work, but today Zach gave an Open Frameworks workshop focusing on [some of the work he's been doing recently](https://www.instagram.com/zach.lieberman/?hl=en).

Also, didn't have my phone all day. That was interesting. Especially in light of Taeyoon's "no google week" assignment. I didn't really mind not having a phone, except that it was really inconvenient to get in touch when you're on the street trying to get in to a friend's apartment.

I also missed being able to take pictures. It was like I was missing a limb.

In the morning, spent the two hours doing yoga in the pier park. Only halfway through did I realize that I was surrounded by geese poop. I made sure to keep on the mat.

Here are some pictures from the demonstration portion at the end of the workshop.
