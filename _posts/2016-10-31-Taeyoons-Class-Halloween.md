Our second Politics of Computation class with Taeyoon. We discussed technology as a means of social control and how it might be possible to modify or improve our relationship with technologies that administer control.

<h2>On the Way to School</h2>

From my walk to school today.

*Reminds me of Ingrid's walk-and-talk on internet infrastructure.*

<h2>Taeyoon's Clas</h2>

For last week's homework, Taeyoon assigned us 10 pages on [Jonathan Crary's "24/7"](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DQAQZMI/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), a book about work and time in the age of Late Capitalism, as well as a six-page reading of [Deleuze's "Postscript on Societies of Control"](https://cidadeinseguranca.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/deleuze_control.pdf).

I enjoyed this reading. It gives context to the world of computing, to why learning to program is a worthwhile endeavor. I find that there is lots that I would like to learn, but I often run out of gas when trying to learn a certain programming language or programming technique.

I think I'm more of a "humanities thinker" than an engineer, so the critical theory and reading about activism, surveillance, and culture are things that I interface with more directly.

<h2>"Can We Have a Different Relationship with Technology"</h2>

In today's class we talked about technology as a means to control. For example, the design of the panopticon is technology. From the panopticon, we talked about the Eames Brothers, Kodak Eastman, and then Microsoft and Google.

**We also discussed:**

- Facebook as "the new tobacco industry"
- Social media literacy
- Data privacy in Japan and Korea
- "What's troubling about startups is the notion of 'exit'." - Taeyoon
- Using the start-up ecosystem as an artist who uses technology
- The word "control"
- Call centers as "control technology"
- Delueze: "The corporation is a spirit, a gas."
- "We seek unmonitored, unmotivated spaces as a creative people." - Taeyoon
- Artists trying to map unmonitored spaces in Singapore.
- The Pentagon, as "as a panopticon inside a panopticon"
- Reliance-internet.org
- Facebook and "the New Colonialism"
- Brave New World, PRISM, Snowden
- Dakota Access Pipeline protests and how Facebook treats dissent. "Checking in" at Standing Rock.

Taeyoon showed us a bunch of neat art projects that use tech, as well. James Bridle's "Drone Shadows", Taeyoon's own project, "Shoot Me if You Can", "NSAHEYYYY", by Surya Mattu. Also, occupy.here and AdNauseum.

<h2>Homework</h2>

Our homework is to "plan a week without google". We're allowed to define what that means. Next Monday, we are assigned to live out our plan. And finally, we will be writing a Medium post at the end of the two weeks about our experience.



Today's class reminded me of an episode of a favorite podcast, *Benjamen Walker's The Theory of Everything*.  The episode is about [Jeremy Bentham, the designer of the panopticon](http://toe.prx.org/).

**For Lunch:**

A prosciutto and mozzarella sandwich from San Panino. Yum!

**For Dinner:**

Leftover steamed dumplings, probably :)
