<p>Volunteered at Eyebeam yesterday for their Tech by Artists workshop. I was glad to be deputized as videographer/photographer for most of the workshop. Here are some of the photos I took of the day:<br/></p><img src="https://67.media.tumblr.com/8268985622e1fc592acec3c40e3a558a/tumblr_inline_oesidihHb51qa0x9g_540.jpg" alt=""/><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/f452ceb7e66436a7f30526548452c4d3/tumblr_inline_oesie1HTPN1qa0x9g_540.jpg" alt=""/><p>We started off the day with some great coffee and Mexican pastries from local favorite <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/ines-bakery-brooklyn">Ines Bakery</a>. Guava y queso empanadas - yum.</p><p>Then <a href="https://twitter.com/mushon">Mushon Zer Aviv</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/suryamattu">Surya Mattu</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/lifewinning">Ingrid Burrington</a> gave a fun workshop on thinking about networks.

There was a contingent of undergrads from Hunter College, the five current Eyebeam Research Artists-in-Residence were in attendance, as well as at least one of Eyebeam’s Impact Residents. There we even two middle-school teachers who drove from Connecticut to attend the workshop.</p><p>I appreciated Mushon, Surya, and Ingrid, not for their workshop. It seems much more effective to elicit conceptual thinking with the use of materials, collaboration, and dialogue, at least in a group setting.

After lunch, <a href="https://twitter.com/allisonburtch">Allison Burtch</a>, whose teaching credits include teaching <a href="https://github.com/allisonburtch/Critical-Theory-of-Technology">a course called Critical Theory of Technology at SFPC</a>, lead a discussion titled: “Politics and Art: Doing Both Is Doing Neither”. </p><figure data-orig-width="5472" data-orig-height="3648" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/bd15025e32bb3a7c329cef65e1e899cd/tumblr_inline_oesjvbs4fe1qa0x9g_540.jpg" data-orig-width="5472" data-orig-height="3648"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="3648" data-orig-height="5472" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://67.media.tumblr.com/6041970e099672a417682784cabb46f3/tumblr_inline_oesjvfQ0BW1qa0x9g_540.jpg" data-orig-width="3648" data-orig-height="5472"/></figure><p>After Allison’s talk, Kevin McCoy and Mushon led a pitch session, in which workshop participants were able to pitch project ideas for critique. No pictures there as I’d begun to primarily shoot video at that point in the workshop.</p><p>The workshop was over around 5:30pm. Everyone was thoroughly pooped from the workshop, but some went and got some of the much-lauded Sunset Park tacos, and some opened a beer, and at 6pm the party started.</p><p>I enjoyed playing bartender for half an hour, practicing my most jovial patter and making change when I could(beer was free, but donations were accepted). I did short interviews with all 5 female research residents(in order: Nora, Morehshin, Mimi, Macon, and Karolina). I really enjoyed to talking to all of them and really appreciated their participation after a long day at the workshop. Each is doing legitimately interesting work and I hope to work with Eyebeam and them again in documenting their work and time at Eyebeam.</p><p>I also got to meet Taeyoon in person, as well as, Yeseul Song, a former SFPC student I’d been corresponding with, who was nice enough to answer some questions I had about what it was like to go through the program.<br/><br/>The whole day was fantastic. I definitely hope to volunteer for Eyebeam again, and possibly even intern if it works out with my SFPC schedule.<br/><br/>More and more, I’m leaning towards staying in New York. We shall see. Just gotta find some paying work so I can afford to stay!</p>
