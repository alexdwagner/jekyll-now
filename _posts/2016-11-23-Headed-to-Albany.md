<h2>Today</h2>

Uber Pooled from Bed Stuy to Penn Station.

It wasn't too bad. Sometimes Uber Pool can take *forever*. The train is usually faster.

I type this section sitting and waiting for the 8:15 Amtrak train to Albany. Was lucky to get a ticket, although I am bummed to be missing Caitlin Morris' arduino class today. When I bought last Sunday, there was only one ticket left at this time - the rest of the day was booked.

Tired. Ready to have a room again. I've really enjoyed bonding with my housemates, but that place is just too damn small. And I feel like I'm always cleaning up after people. I, at the least, need my own room.

I feel like I haven't slept properly in a while. At least I'll have a room in Albany for a couple of nights.

<h2>There</h2>

Made it to Albany. Calm, quiet, college town. I dropped my stuff at the airbnb and set out to read, write, eat, and get a haircut.

Soon after, my sister, her boyfriend, and mom and dad arrived at the airbnb. The rental was spacious, beds were good. They even had a guitar lying around. Not bad, not bad.

<h2>Family Dinner at Pio Pio</h2>

We convened at my grandmother's house in Loudonville, a suburb of Albany, and soon after went to Pio Pio, a hole in the wall Peruvian place near downtown Albany. It was a great big dinner. I ordered Guatita, which is beef tripe in a yellow sauce. I left very full and with a styrofoam container of about 15 pounds of food.

**Breakfast:**

Sausage, egg, and cheese from deli at Penn Station.

**For Lunch:**

I brought my lunch. Sweet potato salad with feta and some pastries from a jerk chicken place.

Later I had a meatball sub.

**For Dinner:**

Guatita(beef tripe) at a Peruvian restaurant called Pio Pio, in an urban part of Albany.
