<h2>Today</h2>

Uber Pooled from Bed Stuy to Penn Station.

*From Uber Pool crossing the bridge*

It wasn't too bad. Sometimes Uber Pool can take *forever*. The train is usually faster.

I type this section sitting and waiting for the 8:15 Amtrak train to Albany. Was lucky to get a ticket, although I am bummed to be missing Caitlin Morris' arduino class today. When I bought last Sunday, there was only one ticket left at this time - the rest of the day was booked.

Tired. Ready to have a room again. I've really enjoyed bonding with my housemates, but that place is just too damn small. And I feel like I'm always cleaning up after people. I, at the least, need my own room.

I feel like I haven't slept properly in a while. At least I'll have a room in Albany for a couple of nights.

**Breakfast:**

Sausage, egg, and cheese from deli at Penn Station.

**For Lunch:**

I brought my lunch. Sweet potato salad with feta and some pastries from a jerk chicken place.

Later I had a meatball sub.

**For Dinner:**

Guatita(beef tripe) at a Peruvian restaurant called Pio Pio, in an urban part of Albany.
