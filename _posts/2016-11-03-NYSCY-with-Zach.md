Today, Zach took us to the [New York Hall of Science](http://nysci.org/) in Queens to see his interactive piece, ["Reflection Study"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOV3FDbpEvI). I love field trips.

<h2>Morning Walk</h2>

On my walk to the train.

When I got to the 14th street stop in Manhattan, there were four cops in full paramilitary gear with assault rifles around this corner. I thought better of photographing them.

They seemed out of place, an overblown response to a war that isn't going to happen for a while or has long since past. Maybe they were there in response to the subway protestors of earlier this week at the Nostrand A/C station in Brooklyn? I don't know.

I walked by and their bad mood was palpable. I'm sure it is kind of a bummer being an attack dog of the state.

<h2>Breakfast</h2>

I got to SFPC at about 10a and ran into my friend Carol, who was exercising her wooly dog, Riley, in the Westbeth courtyard. We'd made plans to have breakfast at The Bus Stop Cafe at 10:30a that day. We agreed to meet in the Westbeth lobby at 10:30a.

Carol, Riley, and I walked to Bus Stop as planned. I had a bacon omelette with home fries, toast, coffee, and orange juice. We talked about a lot of things. I'm going to get to meet her team next Friday - the people who help her put on [Westfest](http://westfestdance.com/), a dance festival that takes place on multiple floors of the Westbeth building.

After breakfast, I said goodbye to Carol in the Westbeth lobby. Soon after, me, Baku, Zach, and Zach's friend/collaborator/former student at Parsons, [Matt Felsen](http://mattfelsen.com/), set out for the New York Hall of Science, which is a kids' science museum.

We took the 7 train from 42nd street. It's a really nice train ride once you get into Queens, all aboveground.

I'm just going to post the copious picture and video I captured in the brief time my phone still had battery.

<h4>Here's Zach explaining to the class how his piece "Reflection Study" works.</h4>

And then we explored the ["Connected Worlds" installation](http://design-io.com/projects/ConnectedWorlds/) next door.

There was a really incredible "interactive book" that went along with the exhibit.

Then back to SFPC on the 7 train.

*Here's a hurried photo of the sunset on my way back from the grocery store.*

We made dinner together, me, Dannie, and Jason(he lost his voice today and was speaking through the text-to-speech app on his phone, often to comedic effect). Now I'm typing up the blog for the day.

*Oh, and Robby organized the hecking heck out of all of the tools and supplies. Good going, kind of jealous you got to organize all of that stuff, Robby, lol*

<h2>Progress</h2>

We have a project review coming up on November 10th. I may just present my blog. I'm finding it incredibly tough to pursue any projects. Also, I'm not sure I feel our homework is relevant. I like the reading but our Electronics Class homework was for naught and I'm just not that interested in creating a puzzlescript game for Ramsey's class tomorrow. I'd rather read or pursue my own ideas.

I guess I've just got too much going on - trying to find a more permanent place to live, interning at Eyebeam, volunteering this weekend at Radical Networks and the Internet Yami Ichi. And doing freelance video editing in between all of that. Am I running myself ragged? No wonder I have no time to learn how to code.

I can't seem to slow down. I guess that's okay? I'm enjoying myself immensely here. This has been a challenging but incredibly worthwhile experience so far.

I just see the programmers doing all the fun stuff and, seemingly, being paid well for it. I want to do that. I want to have a standard of living. I want healthcare and my own apartment and maybe even a dog and a girlfriend.

I don't know that I'll do the homework tonight.

**For Breakfast:**

My friend Carol, who lives at Westbeth, took me to The Bus Stop Cafe as a thank you for helping her with her website. Bacon omelette, homefries, toast, OJ, coffee, yum.

**For Dinner:**

Dannie sauteed kale and squash and I bought a BBQ rotisserie chicken at D'Agostino. Baku was kind enough to share his miso soup. Also, a brownie.
