<h2>Today</h2>

Mostly pictures today. This is a catching-up post. I'll tell the story with images.

I went second, after Adnan. We were allowed three minutes to talk about our project and our experience at the showcase. After that, we received feedback. Here's some of the suggestions I received. Forgive, the formatting - I copy/pasted from my notes.

```
sfpc blog project notes - PRINT ME - the path after school

KEEP WORKING ON THIS
- [ ] make html book
- [ ] make physical book - give one to sfpc
- [ ] make large folding print
- [ ] punch up site - add functionality

materiality of text - objects
adding physical objects/found objects

physically “exploding/expanding” a book into a timeline OR A MAP :D

algorithmic typesetting
algorithmic composition
- postscript

making a big folding map, large print
- creating a large physical object that can be folded

basil.js - generates adobe indesign - http://basiljs.ch/about/
- workshop
- “parametric bookmaking process”

a room full of sketches/WIPs
- “having your own sketches spaced out”

python scripts for typesetting

separate mediums

online book format examples - eloquent javascript, book of shaders

the physical part of the book can be minimal - html book

```

The feedback I received was almost all positive. I was told that my project played to my strengths - writing, photography, and documentation - and I believe that to be true.

<h2>Picture Day</h2>

We were going to grab a group picture at Eyebeam on Wednesday but not everyone was there, so we made one today. I designated myself as class photog. Pretty happy with the results.
