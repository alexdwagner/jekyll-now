It snowed overnight in Beacon. Made it back to Brooklyn to help out at the Alternative Art School Fair.

<h2>Today</h2>

Woke up to snow. Jo was happy. It does not snow in Australia.

We played in the snow. I am better at throwing snowballs than she is. Go figure.

At around noon we were on the train headed back to Brooklyn.

<h2>Alternative Arts Fair at Pioneer Works</h2>

Lots of neat alternative art schools there. Schools from London, Paris, NYC were all represented. Was especially interested in The School of Making Thinking and the new Black Mountain College that has started in NYC.
