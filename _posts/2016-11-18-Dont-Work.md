<h2>Adventure</h2>

Getting out of the city and going hiking with a friend this weekend. Should be fun. Will make pictchas.

<h2>Alternative Art School Fair: This Weekend</h2>

Volunteering for the Alternative Art School Fair at Pioneer Works this Sunday. Manning the SFPC table for a couple of hours. Should be fun.

Will be scouting what the my next alternative education experience might be. Good times.
