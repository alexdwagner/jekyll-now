Physical computing with Phillip Stearns today. Robby taught an origami workshop this afternoon - [check out his instagram here](https://www.instagram.com/gridpaper/) - well worth your time). We also have a [shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/) workshop with [Patricio Gonzalez Vivo](http://patriciogonzalezvivo.com/) tonight from 6p-9p.

<h2>Last Night</h2>

Ingrid tweeted [the blog post I wrote](https://alexdwagner.github.io/Ingrid-ARCH-Walking-Tour/) about her [walking tour of NYC telecommunications history](https://twitter.com/lifewinning/status/790652064141602816).

I am honored and so glad - the post took me three hours to write and to edit the audio of the tour!

<Robby's Origami Workshop</h2>

Began this afternoon at 3pm. I needed time to work on other things so I did not attend.

However, you should check out his Instagram. His work is really good.

<h2>Deep Learning Lunch</h2>

We made lunch together - a rice stir-fry. It was good and spicy.

And then Jason, classmate, applied a deep learning style to it:

<h2>Shaders with Patricio</h2>

*At the beginning of the workshop.*

I haven't really coded at all in C, so this workshop was challenging, but a lot of fun.

My takeaway: the secret to life is normalizing from 0 to 1. And sine waves.

Our homework was to create our own skies, our own sunsets, using code.

That's all I can say right now - it's been a long day(but a good day). Usually we just have one class in the morning but today we had two three-hour classes, plus the workshop for those that chose to attend.

**For Lunch:** Rice stir fry, as described above.

**For Dinner:** Ramen and a soft-boiled egg. Not bad.
