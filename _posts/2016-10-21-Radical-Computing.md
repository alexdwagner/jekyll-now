Ramsey Nasser's Radical Computing class was today. It was fantastic.

<h2> Radical Computing with Ramsey </h2>

We discussed core concepts of computer science: [programming language theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory), [compiler theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler#Compiler_construction), the theory of computation.

But actually we had a lot of fun.

Ramsey's class really complements Taeyoon's "Politics of Computation" class by putting some of those politics into practice(see [%D9%82%D9%84%D8%A8](http://nas.sr/%D9%82%D9%84%D8%A8/) - the first programming language written in Arabic).

First of all, Ramsey used an "infinite whiteboard" app of his own creation, that the class really kind of oohed and aahed over([github repo here](https://github.com/nasser/boards)). Basically, all you need is a computer, a digital tablet(like a Wacom or similar), and a screen(works well with a projector), and you can draw across an infinite space of white. Such a great tool!

Here's the class watching most of John Cage performing his piece, "4'33" ". It's related because we discussed computation from the perspective of rule-based art. Fluxus, John Cage, On Kawara were all mentioned.

And then we watched the death metal version.
