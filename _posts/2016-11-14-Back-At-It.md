Taeyoon's class today. Eyebeam internship. Back home for some quiet time while roommates are at school. So much to do.

<h2>Today</h2>

In Taeyoon's class we talked about body politics and intersectionality.

We also did this exercise outside:

My Westbeth friends Riley and Carol were out there as well.

In class, my classmate Adnan had laid out some photos he's taken over the course of our semester at SFPC. These photos are from the day Taeyoon cooked bibimbap for us and Zach gave a talk about his work.

After class, I had my Eyebeam internship. Always a good time. I think the blog piece I'm working on will be published soon. Exciting :)

Of course, I stopped at Ines Bakery on the way in and way out.

Afterwards, I met a friend for tex-mex in Clinton Hill. Pulled pork tacos. It's been too long.

Went home after that and worked on client work. Went to bed about midnight.

**For Lunch:**

Meatballs, mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes from the notorious D'AG mart.

**For Dinner:**

Pulled pork tacos at a place in Clinton Hill. Not bad, New York. Not bad.
