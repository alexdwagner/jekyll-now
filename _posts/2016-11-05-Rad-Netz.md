It's been a radical weekend so far, with a Radical Comp Sci class yesterday, volunteering for Radical Networks yesterday and today, and then the Internet Yami Ichi tomorrow!

I was assigned to place signage along the street on Saturday morning. Was especially proud of this posting method:

<h2>Radical Networks: A Run Down of My Day</h2>

First of all, if you missed any of it [there's a livestream of all events and workshops](https://livestream.com/internetsociety/radnetworks). Thanks to The Internet Society for capturing and streaming!

- We had bagels for breakfast. One of the Eyebeam staff brought fresh dill. Never tried it - I'm a fan.
- During one of the talks, somebody called my name for something and I moved to quickly and one of my lenses fell out of my lens bag I had on my belt. It broke :( It don't focus no' mo'. Gotta get it fixed. Ah well. Photo things get broken, it happens.

<h3>Edwin Reed-Sanchez and Dehruv Mahrotra: Community Based Communication Networks in Nicaragua's Autonomous Region</h3>

The first talk of the day was from [Edwin Reed Sanchez](http://radicalnetworks.org/participants/edwin-reed-sanchez/) and Dehruv Mehrotra. Edwin has a research group named [Saycel](http://list.saycel.com/), which creates cellphone networks in rural Caribbean and Latin American communities that don't have them. I first heard Edwin speak at ITP Camp this summer. I really dig what he's doing. Glad to see him at Rad Netz.

<h3>Brett Ian Balogh: Wilderness Wireless Workshop</h3>

[Brett Ian Balogh's](http://radicalnetworks.org/participants/brett-ian-balogh/) "Wilderness Wireless" workshop was really cool. For about $100, you can buy a kit to create a solar-powered wifi access point in the wilderness. From this point you could host a website or serve files such as books, pictures, or any other kind of data.

At the time of this writing, the video from the workshop is not up but [check the Radical Networks 2016 livestream.com account](https://livestream.com/internetsociety/radnetworks) and it may be up soon.

<h3>The Rest of the Day</h3>

To be honest, I didn't really watch enough of the talks to give any thorough description of them. Was too busy making pretty pictures. Great bunch of folks though, talked to a lot of people.

Here's my ITP Camp friend [Pierre Depaz](http://radicalnetworks.org/participants/pierre-depaz/) speaking about ["Proactive Protest with Software"](https://livestream.com/internetsociety/radnetworks/videos/141072585).

Daniel Temkin reading righteously, heroically from a scroll of internet domain names that begin with "dont". [See the livestream for his performance.](https://livestream.com/internetsociety/radnetworks/videos/141103339)

<h3>Protective Rituals for Post-humans</h3>

![Rad Netz sign](/images/radnetz_11052016__7.JPG)

Sarah Friend and Rachel Boyce perform a techno-witchcraft ritual that involves bowing to a wifi router on an altar and creating a protective circle with ethernet cable.

Great fun. Really enjoyed this one. [Watch it here.](https://livestream.com/internetsociety/radnetworks/videos/141084782)

I also did video interviews with the founders of the conference, Sarah Grant, Amelia Marzec, and Erica Kermani. For archival purposes but also may be incorporated into a piece that I'm working on for Eyebeam's Stop Work blog.

Went home when the conference ended for the day at about 9:30p. My creaky bike made it almost all the way home, but the chain popped off when I was just about to turn into the final half-mile downhill part of my ride. Walked it the 12 blocks home. Downloaded footage, showered, repacked photo things for the Yami Ichi. Slept well.

**For Lunch:**

A chicken cheesesteak sandwich from a bodega down the street from Chemistry Creative, the venue in which Radical Networks was held.

**For Dinner:**

First, pizza from Williamsburg Pizza, at the conference.

Went to [Newtown](), which was down the street from the venue. A little middle-eastern/French vegetarian place. Delicious and cheap. Will definitely go back.
