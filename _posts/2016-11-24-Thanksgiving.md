<h2>Today</h2>

We arrived at Nona's, my grandmother's at about noon. We ate bagels, lots of bagels, at a leisurely pace.

At around 4pm, dinner was served. So much food.

*We played cards after a late breakfast. Our game ended when it was time to start setting the table for Thanksgiving dinner.*

After dinner, I played guitar, which I don't do very much. Happy to have an audience.
