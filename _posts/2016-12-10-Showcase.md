Today was the first day of our final showcase. It's a been a wild ride. I've experienced a lot, so many ups and downs in these nine weeks.

I came in at noon and the showcase was set to begin at 2pm. I added some things to my piece, little keepsakes and totems I've accumulated during my time at the school: a menu from Ines Bakery in Sunset Park, stickers from the Internet Yami Ichi, my wig from a Halloween party where I went dressed as Vincent Vega from Pulp Fiction.

At 2pm, people started to arrive for the showcase. I sat in a corner and worked on my blog while people came through the door. I chatted with some of them. Andy Dayton, of SFPC's first ever class, said some kind things about the blog. I was flattered he'd read it :)

I started to get tired(it'd been a long week and I'd been talking to people for 3 or 4 hours by then) and I left around 7pm to go hang with non-school friends.
