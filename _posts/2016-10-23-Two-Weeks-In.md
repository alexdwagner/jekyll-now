Busy busy! Sunny and windy on a Sunday afternoon.

<h3>My day, in photos, thus far:</h3>

*On the way to the train to go to Chinatown for Dim Sum, we found some mannequin legs in the trash.*

*Dim Sum took too long, so I bounced just as our number was called. I was full from eating two smaller breakfasts earlier. In Chinatown:*
