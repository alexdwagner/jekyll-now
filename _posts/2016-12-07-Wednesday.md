Worked on connecting Processing and Open Frameworks in Caitlin's class today.

<h2>Today: P. Comp</h2>

Caitlin's physical computing class this morning, our last with her. She put together a nice repo of class sketches[that can be found here.](https://github.com/caitlinmorris/sfpc-pcomp-f2016).

We worked on using Open Frameworks to control inputs to an Arduino board.

[Firmata Builder](http://firmatabuilder.com/).

We also created a sketch in Open Frameworks to work with OSC data.

At the end of class, we thanked Caitlin and said goodbye. It went by so fast! I wish I'd been able to engage the class in a deeper way, but life happens.

<h2>After Class</h2>

Didn't sleep well last night, so I spent the afternoon hanging out on the couch. Messing with the blog, trying to figure out how to make a book from it. That's what I'd like to do for my final project, but it's seeming less and less feasible.

I can't help but feel like these last weeks at SFPC feel a bit anticlimactic, but there are other factors involved. Love-life stuff, I guess. I'm also not doing a final project, I don't think. I haven't been as present here as I maybe could've or should've been if I hadn't began and ended a tumultuous one month fling in the time that I was here.

Feeling beat today, but I think I'm coming through it as I type this. Going to get dumplings with a friend later, and then I'm going to go home and play the guitar.

Tomorrow a Dallas friend is in town and she's having a get together at a bar. Should be fun.

Still looking for a permanent place in NYC. This weekend Nate and I are looking at another place in Bushwick.

That's all for today. I'm bushed.
