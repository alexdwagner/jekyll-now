Today, sweetheart and I made breakfast, went to Minneswaska Falls, and I bought a guitar. Later, we made dinner and had a little party with our Airbnb hosts.

<h2>Today</h2>

<h2>Lake Minnewaska</h2>

We came upstate to go on a hike, that was our intended goal when we'd planned the trip last week. Lake Minnewaska wasn't much of a hike at all, but maaaan was it pretty. I could've sat by that waterfall all day, and then some.

<h2>Bought a Guitar</h2>

After Minnewaska, we passed back through the small college town of New Paltz. We stopped at the 1st guitar store we saw, which was actually kind of a counter or booth inside an expansive coffeeshop.

I bought the second guitar I played, an Epiphone Masterbilt. Pretty solid little acoustic guitar - nice, clear sound, low action, good sustain. Not a bad price either. I paid half of what I was ready to spend.

Afterwards we stopped at a grocery store and wine shop to grab dinner provisions.

<h2>Japanese Food</h2>

In our cozy cottage kitchen, she made [Katsudon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsudon) for dinner. It was delicious.

<h2>Didi and the Gang</h2>

Our host Didi, was kind enough to invite us over to her home, where she was having a little party with friends and family. We drank sake and Beaujolais Nouveau 2016, and traded stories. At a certain point her current husband, Jim and ex-husband, Lars, picked up guitars. I ran and grabbed mine and we had a little hootenanny.

*This is the best picture we have of the revelry that took place.*

Didi was so nice. She even gave us a bottle of Beaujolais Nouveau 2016 to take home. Hope to see her again.
