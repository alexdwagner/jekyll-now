Today in Ingrid's class, we took apart iPhones to inspect and discuss the materials inside.

<h2>Ingrid's Class</h2>

In groups of two, we took apart iPhones and gave short presentations on the different metals the phones contained(the metals to research were pre-assisnged; Dannie and I had copper).

When we were starting out and were told by Ingrid to choose a phone to take apart, something in my gut told me to grab the oldest iPhone, a 3GS.

Turns out, the older the iPhone, the easier it is to take apart. It took me maybe 15-20 minutes to disassemble my phone, while teams with iPhone 4s and 5s really had to fiddle with them a bit more.

I love taking things apart, so this class was a lot of fun.

After class, did some planning for freelance work, answered some emails, and figured out what I might be able to accomplish over the Thanksgiving break.

Going upstate to my grandmother's for Thanksgiving. Family time and r'n'r sounds real nice right about now.
