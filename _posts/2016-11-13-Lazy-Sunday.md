Lazy day today. Woke up late, got breakfast with a friend, hung out with roommates, made dinner, watched a movie and crashed. Some days it's important to not work.

At around noon, hung out with the roommates and talked about the state of politics, Trump, gentrification. Is this what it feels like to be a revolutionary?
