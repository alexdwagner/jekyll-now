Had our seventh class with Ramsey. Then picked up a sweet car in Hoboken, and drove up to Poughkeepsie for a nice weekend.

**In the morning:**

*Forever Bed Stuy*

Had to take the path over to Hoboken(no jokin'), to pick up our car from Turo, which is a car-sharing app. It was wayyy cheaper than Zipcar, if less convenient. But Zipcar was twice as much, and we got a Lexus(niiiice)!

I met Joanna, who was the wife of the man renting us the car, at Carlo's Bakery(my choice), which is famous as the bakery from the reality TV show *Cake Boss*. I bought some sweet treats for later.

Then I picked up my sweetheart (in Ridgewood, Queens), and away we did ride.

We got to our Airbnb in Poughkeepsie at around 10pm(I don't like night driving), had a bottle of white wine, and went to bed.

**For Lunch:**

Two-day old hamburger hero I'd saved from the deli.

**For Dinner:**

Chicken quesadillas and mashed potatoes at a barbecue place in Scrub Oak, NY. And a Stella. She had a hot dog.
