<h2>Today</h2>

We had breakfast at Nona's("Would you like more sausage? Have some more sausage!") and then chased birds and fat squirrels outside with Christian's camera.

Aunt Cami and I took a quick walk around the block.

*My favorite trees in the neighborhood. A certain kind of birch, in which it's bark peels off.*

At around 2:30, we said goodbye to Nona, Aunt Cami, Uncle Al. We left - no, I left, with so much leftovers in plastic bags. Uncle Chris gave us and ride to the train station(thanks again!).

Rode the train South with parents. We were too slow to get in line and did not get seats on the side of the train with the Hudson view. It's fine though, the weather was generally dark gray and cloudy.

Gonna have dinner with parents and call it an early night. Need to work on school/work/internship stuff today.
