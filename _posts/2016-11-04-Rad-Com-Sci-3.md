<h2>Today's Class</h2>

I enjoy Ramsey's class. He brings an honest enthusiasm to his teaching and subject material. It's infectious. Doesn't matter what mood I'm in, his class is just good.

We talked about:
- “What does it mean for a computer to unlock mathematical abstractions. Like, physically.”
- Meta concepts in computing. The Lambda Calculus contains "pure" logic, but any programming language has a semantics that's arbitrary.
- “Sometimes [when you’re coding], it feels like you’re driving a car… that’s driving a car… that’s driving a car...and the last car is driving somewhere into infinity.”
- Lady [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace)
- Logic gates with the help of the [Falstad circuit simulator](http://www.falstad.com/circuit/).
- “What you see when you see a silicon chip - you’re remixing a bunch of [NAND gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate), basically.”
- The [Julia](http://julialang.org/) programming language.

<h2>This Weekend</h2>

Volunteering at [Radical Networks](www.radicalnetworks.org) tonight and tomorrow. I may not make it until 4pm or so. The talks will be over by then but there are parties from 6p-9p. I will ever-so-humbly offer my efforts in the hopes of being useful.

Didn't take a lot of pictures today. Will probably be taking some tonight. Will definitely be taking a lot on Saturday for RadNetz and Sunday for the Yami Ichi.

Will post accordingly.

**For Lunch:**

Ramens with chicken and egg. Ruby says I need to eat things beside ramen and chicken(for nutrition), but that's just not true. Ramen has all the food groups: noodles, broth, meat, egg.

**For Dinner:**

? I don't remember.
