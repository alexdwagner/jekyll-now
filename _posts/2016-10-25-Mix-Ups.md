A scheduling mix-up today. Physical computing class got rescheduled for tomorrow. Came up with some solid project ideas with my classmate, Katrina. I am tired.

-----

We were supposed to have Phillip Stearns physical computing class today, but the class got confused because we normally don't have class on Tuesday - so some of us showed and some didn't until later. Phillip decided to move the class to tomorrow morning and just have office hours today.

Things that have happened so far today:

- Brooklyn morning sky. Bird vs. Airplane.

- saw this sweet bike.

- got to school before class and did some freelance work.
- class got rescheduled.
- got in a tiff with two of my roommates at school because I feel like they rarely clean up after themselves, both at school and at home.
- had a great talk with my classmate Katrina. we came up with a bunch of project ideas. Legit excited.

Also, I've recently made friends with Carol, a Westbeth resident and choreographer. I spent some time helping her with her website yesterday. When I finish the few changes to her site, she says she's going to take me to The Bus Stop Cafe, which apparently has a great breakfast!

I love breakfast.

It's almost three but I think I'm done for the day. I'm tired. Thought I'd be fine sleeping 5-6 hours and getting to school early but I think I need to start getting better sleep.

I also think I'm spending too much time up here at SFPC. I need to get out, do other things. It'd be one thing if I had a project, but I don't. I just like to work, period. I'd rather be learning or making progress on a project but I think sometimes that I just work and work and work because I don't know what else to do.

Also, my boss at Eyebeam, David, was sick today, so no internship today. Kind of glad as I'm grateful to spend the time reading.

Tomorrow we have both Phillip Stearns' P. Comp. class and a workshop with Patricio Vivo Gonzalez on shaderzzzzzzzzz. Going to focus on school tomorrow. No outside work.

**For Lunch:** The microwave came in the mail, and so did my ramen noodles from Amazon. So, microwaved semi-fancy ramen with shredded chicken tender and mashed potatoes mixed in.

**For Dinner:** Not sure.
