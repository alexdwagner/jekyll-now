<p>Anxious to get started. We got the list of our classes on Monday, I believe. Really looking forward to learning from <a href="http://nas.sr/%D9%82%D9%84%D8%A8/">Ramsey</a>, <a href="http://taeyoonchoi.com/">Taeyoon</a>, and <a href="http://lifewinning.com/">Ingrid</a> but I expect to enjoy all of the classes being offered this fall. I was really hoping <a href="http://www.decontextualize.com/">Allison Parrish</a> would be there because I really dig her work but hopefully I’ll get the chance to learn from her in the future. Heck, I’ve learned so much already from <a href="http://www.decontextualize.com/teaching/">her copious online resources</a>.</p><p>Picked up a copy of <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/Uncreative-Writing/128908/">Kenneth Goldsmith’s </a><i><a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/Uncreative-Writing/128908/">Uncreative Writing</a> </i>today, as well as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Madness-Rack-Honey-Collected-Lectures/dp/1933517573">Mary Rueffle’s <i>Madness, Rack, and Honey</i></a>, which is a series of lectures about poetry. I’ve enjoyed reading actual English sentences and thoughts again - learning code sometimes feels like learning Russian or Mandarin or something. I enjoy the critical theory and humanities-thinking. It makes more sense to me.</p><p>That said, I have been pretty bad about training myself up to code in this past week. I wanted to get proficient(as a beginner) in C++, Python, and the Unix command line but I got to NYC on Monday 10/3 and pretty much have been just getting adjusted to life here. </p><!-- more --><p>On Tuesday, 10/4, I hung out with my SFPC classmate <a href="https://vimeo.com/pleek">Agustin Ramos Anzorena</a>. We got bagels in Park Slope, then walked Prospect Park and down to the Kensington neighborhood where I’m staying and did a laptop hang. He’s been getting a lot of Vimeo hits recently for a really cool project he created called <i><a href="https://vimeo.com/176545135">Huichol Pattern Generator</a>.</i></p><p>The first sentence of the description from the video:</p><p><i>The Huichol Pattern Generator is software for the generation of colorfull patterns that animate over a grid. It is based on the kind of structure present in the art of the Huichol, a Mexican MesoAmerican culture.</i></p><figure class="tmblr-embed tmblr-full" data-provider="vimeo" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="277" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F176545135"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/176545135?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="540" height="277" frameborder="0" title="Huichol Pattern Generator - Software Demo" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>The Huichol Pattern Generator’s output is supposed to be projected inside a dome, to mimic the effect of being inside a mesoAmerican sweat lodge, says Agustin. Definitely worth watching full-screen.</p><hr><p>Also, I am very, very excited to volunteer for <a href="http://eyebeam.org/events/tech-by-artists/">Eyebeam’s Tech by Artists workshop</a> from 10am-6pm. That’s perfect because they’re hosting a party that starts at 6pm, and I may or may not even have a date who’s coming to the party(she’s bringing her sister, still counts). Agustin’s volunteering as well. It should be a lot of fun.</p><p>I’ve been riding my bike in the city, after boxing it up and checking it when I flew from Dallas. Holy crap New York is a dangerous place to ride a bike. I rode from south of Prospect Park, across the Brooklyn Bridge, and to Greenwich Village without a helmet to hang out with an improv comedy friend. I think it was about 5 miles from Kensington to Greenwich Village.</p><p>On the way back to Brooklyn, I popped into an East Village bike shop, <a href="http://continuumcycles.com/site/">Continuum Cyclery</a>, to look at helmets. I wanted a skate helmet because for some reason I’m 30 and still concerned about looking cool. None of them fit. Jeff, the guy at the shop handed me a white, dorky one, and as I was trying on the helmet, at that exact moment, this lyric from Bowie’s “Space Oddity” played from the shop radio: </p><p><i>“Take your protein pills and put your helmet on”</i><br/></p><p>I basically threw my money at Jeff. </p><p>The price for the helmet was $45, which was a little high, but as soon as I heard that lyric, I was like, </p><p>“I’ll take it - it’s a sign, man. I rode here from Ditmas Park without a helmet and the whole time, I was just thinking ‘I am a complete idiot to be riding my bike in NYC without a helmet’.”</p><p>In so many words, he agreed, took my money, and sent me on my way. The helmet was even big enough that I could wear my ratty old Arri Film hat underneath it.</p><p>I came back across the Williamsburg bridge, which had a lot less walkers. I’m thinking about riding my bike to school when I relocate to Bed Stuy - I’ll probably take the Williamsburg Bridge. It’s more chill, as a bike rider. </p><p>Across the bridge I stopped by North Brooklyn Farms, which had a nice view of what was probably the Brooklyn Bridge.</p><figure class="tmblr-embed tmblr-full" data-provider="vimeo" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="304" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F185895096"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/185895096?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="540" height="304" frameborder="0" title="Brooklyn Bridge from North Brooklyn Farms" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>On the way back I took a break and stopped at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/unnameable">Unnameable Books</a> and bought <i>Madness, Rack, and Honey</i>, and had a tea and a chocolate chip cookie next door at some fancy cupcake place. It was late afternoon. Golden hour - especially pretty when it’s New York and Fall.</p><p>I made it home by way of Prospect Park, locked up my bike, bought some groceries and made a pretty decent salad(arugula, hardboiled egg with chili garlic hotsauce, roasted garlic cloves). I ordered groceries from Amazon pantry on Tuesday and they arrived just before 8pm, so I got double-groceries. I made rice for lunches and did the dishes and now I’m procrastinating finishing some freelance work that I need to do.</p><p>Tomorrow, I plan to spend most of the day reading at Prospect Park, and then I’m going to check out a museum or two with Agustin(free from 4-8 on Fridays! apparently).</p><p>Last thing: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hito_Steyerl">Hito Steyerl</a>, one of my favorite working artists, published a really solid article today considering art as alternative currency and art’s place in finance and culture in a world that’s becoming more unequal and more violent. It’s worth reading. It’s titled:<br/></p><p><a href="http://www.e-flux.com/journal/76/69732/if-you-don-t-have-bread-eat-art-contemporary-art-and-derivative-fascisms/">If You Don’t Have Bread, Eat Art!: Contemporary Art and Derivative Fascisms</a></p><figure data-orig-width="750" data-orig-height="1334" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/9ca5502984e1253317e8b6c7524b7f75/tumblr_inline_oenmorIdmx1qa0x9g_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="750" data-orig-height="1334"/></figure>
